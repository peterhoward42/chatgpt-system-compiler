SPEC CANONICALISATION
==============================================================================

PURPOSE AND ROLE
----------------
This document defines how future versions of the various specification types
in this pack
should be transformed into a clean, minimal, compiler-friendly baseline.

This cleanup process is a transformation and normalisation step. It is not a
redesign, extension, or reinterpretation of scope.

AUTHORITATIVE INPUT
-------------------
The input to the cleanup process is a single specification written by
the author.  That input is authoritative.

The cleanup process MUST preserve the author’s intent and semantics unless the
author explicitly changes them in a later iteration.

HIGH-LEVEL CLEANUP GOALS
-----------------------
The cleaned specification MUST be as brief as possible without losing meaning.
It MUST minimise ambiguity and hidden assumptions. 
It MUST make strict rules,
assumptions, non-goals, and policies explicit. 
It MUST serve as a durable baseline across many iterations.


SEMANTIC TAGGING RULES
---------------------
The cleaned specification MUST use explicit semantic tags in section headings.
Permitted tags include MUST, MUST NOT, SHOULD, MAY, ASSUME, LOCKED, and NON-GOALS.

If a requirement, prohibition, preference, policy, assumption, invariant, or
non-goal can reasonably be inferred from the input, it SHOULD be encoded
explicitly rather than left implicit.

ASSUME, DON’T ASK POLICY
-----------------------
The cleanup process MUST follow an assume-don’t-ask policy.

If the input specification is ambiguous but a conservative, reasonable
interpretation exists, the cleanup process SHOULD choose that interpretation and
encode it explicitly using MUST or ASSUME.

Clarifying questions to the author SHOULD be avoided unless ambiguity would cause
material semantic divergence. In such cases, the cleanup process MAY add a short
inline note.

INLINE NOTES POLICY
-------------------
Inline notes to the author are permitted but MUST be rare. Notes SHOULD highlight
preserved intentional oddities or unresolved ambiguity and MUST never block
completion of the cleanup process.

The cleaned specification MUST be complete and usable even if notes are present.

NON-LOSSINESS INVARIANT
----------------------
The cleanup output MUST be factually and semantically non-lossy relative to the
input specification.

Every distinct requirement, prohibition, preference, policy, assumption,
invariant, deliverable, and non-goal present in the input MUST still exist in the
output in some form.

The cleanup process MAY rephrase, reorganise, deduplicate, and consolidate
statements, but it MUST NOT delete meaning. If an input statement is removed,
its full meaning MUST be preserved elsewhere in the output.

If multiple input statements are collapsed into a single output sentence, that
sentence MUST fully cover all collapsed meanings.

If any input statement is too ambiguous to preserve faithfully, the cleanup
process MUST preserve it verbatim and MAY add a short note to the author
explaining the ambiguity.

STRUCTURAL RULES
----------------
The cleaned specification MUST obey the following structural rules.

The document SHOULD be formatted in Markdown , and the structural semantics
provided by markdown are encouraged to be used.


CONTENT NORMALISATION RULES
---------------------------
During cleanup, the system SHOULD convert informal or narrative prose into
declarative statements. It SHOULD collapse verbose explanations into concise
language where meaning is preserved. It SHOULD group invariants into clearly
marked LOCKED sections. 
It SHOULD state
non-goals explicitly to prevent scope creep.

The cleanup process MUST NOT introduce new features, redesign the system, add
best practices not present in the input, expand scope beyond the author’s intent,
or remove intentional constraints or experimental framing.


ANCILLARY REQUIREMENTS SINK
---------------------------
If a requirement, policy, or rule does not fit cleanly into the system,
generation, or tooling planes, the cleanup process MUST still preserve it in a
clearly labelled section rather than dropping it.

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS
-------------------
The output of the cleanup process MUST be a single, self-contained  
markdown document.
. It must be returned in the ChatGPT response as a downloadable 
file (not an output pane in the UI).

USAGE INSTRUCTION
-----------------
To repeat this cleanup process in the future, provide the current draft
specification together with this document and request a rewrite according to
these unified cleanup and normalisation instructions.
