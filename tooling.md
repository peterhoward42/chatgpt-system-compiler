# TOOLING SPECIFICATION (tooling.md)

## REPOSITORY ARTEFACTS (TOOLING PLANE, MUST)

The generated repository must include a copy of this set of specification files
in the /input-specs directory.

A README must be included and say nothing except that the entire code repository has been autogenerated from a set 
of specification in the /input-specs directory. It should refer the reader to the README.md that is inside the /input-specs directory.

## MAKEFILE OPERATIONS (TOOLING PLANE, SHOULD)

The repository should include a Makefile.

The following make targets should be included:

- deployment // command line command to deploy the google cloud function to google cloud
- post-event // illustrative command line command to POST an event to the generated API
- analyse // illustrative command line command to GET the analysis report
- test // go test -count=1 ./...
- lint // golangci-lint run

## ASSUMPTIONS TRACKING MECHANISM (TOOLING PLANE, SHOULD)

The repository should include a plain-text assumptions log recording
implementation assumptions not explicitly stated in this specification. Each
assumption should reference relevant source files and searchable comment text.
