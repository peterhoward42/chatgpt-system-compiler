# TOOLING SPECIFICATION (Canonical)

## PURPOSE (MUST)
This document defines tooling-plane requirements for generated repositories.

It governs repository artefacts, build and operational tooling, and mechanisms
for recording assumptions made during generation.

## REPOSITORY ARTEFACTS (MUST)
The generated repository MUST include a copy of this entire specification pack
in the `/input-specs` directory.

A `README.md` MUST be included at the repository root and MUST:
- state only that the repository has been autogenerated from specifications in
  `/input-specs`, and
- refer the reader to the `README.md` inside `/input-specs` for further context.

## MAKEFILE (SHOULD)
The repository SHOULD include a `Makefile`.

If present, the `Makefile` SHOULD define the following targets:

- `deployment`: deploy the Google Cloud Function.
- `post-event`: illustrative command to POST an event to the API.
- `analyse`: illustrative command to GET the analysis report.
- `test`: run `go test -count=1 ./...`.
- `lint`: run `golangci-lint`.

## LINTING BEHAVIOUR (MUST)
If a `lint` target exists:
- it MUST invoke `golangci-lint`,
- it MUST use the default configuration,
- it MUST NOT specify a custom configuration file or flags.

## ASSUMPTIONS TRACKING (SHOULD)
The repository SHOULD include a plain-text assumptions log.

The assumptions log SHOULD:
- record implementation assumptions not explicitly stated in the specification,
- reference relevant source files,
- include searchable comment text.

This mechanism exists to surface and track unavoidable interpretive decisions
made during generation.
