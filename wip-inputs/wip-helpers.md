Please extract the XXX PLANE parts of "drawexact-telemetry-combined-spec" to produce a "XXX.md specification". With the extraction process governed as follows: This is a verbatim extraction, not a rewrite. You may only copy text that already exists in the source document. You may reorder or group extracted text, but you may not paraphrase it. You may not introduce new requirements, assumptions, or defaults. If a statement is not present in the source, it must not appear. Loss of in-scope MUST or LOCKED clauses is an error. If scope boundaries are ambiguous, flag them instead of guessing.


Please canonicalise the compliance.md file using the process defined in the canonicalisation.md file.
